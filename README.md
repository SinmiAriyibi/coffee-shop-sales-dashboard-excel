## Project Snapshot

This dashboard answers key business questions such as:

## Data Preparation

To ensure accuracy and usability, I prepared the dataset by:

- Removing duplicates and correcting formatting inconsistencies
- Handling missing values and invalid entries
- Standardizing product/category labels
- Creating calculated fields for performance KPIs
- Structuring tables for PivotTables and visual reporting

## KPI Framework

This dashboard focuses on core business KPIs:

- **Total Revenue**
- **Total Orders**

  *(Revenue ÷ Orders)*

## Dashboard Design Strategy

The dashboard is organized into a clean reporting layout:

### 1) KPI Header Section  
A quick snapshot of business performance with primary KPIs at the top.

### 2) Monthly Sales Trend  
A trend chart to visualize month-over-month performance and seasonality.

### 3) Product & Category Breakdown  
Charts/tables showing which categories and products generate the most revenue and volume.

### 4) Top / Bottom Performance View  
Rankings to quickly identify:
- best-performing products
- underperforming products
- potential targets for promotion or optimization

### 5) Filters / Slicers (if applicable)  
Segmentation options such as:
- month
- category
- product
